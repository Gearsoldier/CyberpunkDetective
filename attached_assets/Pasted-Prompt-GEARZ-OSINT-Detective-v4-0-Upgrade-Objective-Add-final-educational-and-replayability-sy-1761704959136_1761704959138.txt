Prompt: GEARZ OSINT Detective v4.0 Upgrade

Objective:
Add final educational and replayability systems with an optional AI Instructor mode (only active if player enters a valid API key). Maintain performance and mobile support.

Upgrades:
1. 🎓 OSINT Glossary
   • Add a “Knowledge Base” tab accessible from HUD.
   • Store content in /data/glossary.json (term, definition, category, examples).
   • Each glossary entry includes “Test Me” button to launch a quick 3-question quiz.
   • Track glossary completion in DB for bonus XP.

2. 🧠 Optional AI Instructor Mode
   • Add toggle in Settings: “Enable AI Instructor”.
   • When enabled, show API key input field.
   • If valid OpenAI/HuggingFace key entered → activate instructor chat window in Mentor panel.
   • Players can ask: “Explain this deeper” or “Show real-world example”.
   • If no key, fallback to built-in static mentor dialogue.
   • Keys never saved permanently — store only in sessionStorage.

3. 🧩 Daily Cases System
   • Add endpoint /api/daily to serve a random case template.
   • Generate case ID + clue set daily (date-based seed).
   • Track completion streaks and award bonus XP for consistent play.

4. 🏆 Leaderboard
   • Add /api/leaderboard for global scores (codename, XP, efficiency).
   • Show top 10 agents; anonymize data if player opts out.
   • Add “Share My Stats” button → copies summary text.

5. 📚 Learning Flow Polish
   • “What You Learned” panels link to glossary terms.
   • Add mini-quiz after every 5 missions.
   • Include retry button for wrong answers.

6. 🎨 UI Enhancements
   • Add glow ripple animation on buttons.
   • Smooth mission transitions with sliding effect.
   • Responsive grid fixes for ultra-wide and mobile.
   • Optional music toggle + new ambient layer.

7. ⚙️ Code/Architecture
   • Glossary data → JSON.
   • AI Instructor logic → /lib/instructor.ts.
   • Leaderboard → /server/routes/leaderboard.js.
   • Daily case generator → /server/routes/daily.js.
   • Add environment variable: OPENAI_API_KEY (optional).

8. 🚀 Finalize for Public Launch
   • Verify all URLs (Replit, Contra, GitHub) in About page.
   • Test both modes: AI Instructor ON/OFF.
   • Ensure mobile responsiveness and data persistence.
   • Deploy and publish Replit Showcase build.

Goal:
Deliver GEARZ OSINT Detective v4.0 — the definitive, gamified OSINT learning simulator with daily missions, global leaderboard, glossary learning, and optional AI Instructor for deeper training.
